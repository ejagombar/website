            Hi, I am an Electronic and Computer Engineer, looking for a job in software engineering. I recently
            achieved a First class degree in my Master's at the University of Nottingham. <br /><br />

            In my free time, I enjoy working on software projects and building stuff. Some recent examples can be
            found under the portfolio page. I like to try new things and explore new areas, such as my current
            project, WikiMapper, where I am processing Wikipedia XML dumps with C++ to create a visual graph
            database. <br /><br />

            Now that I have graduated, I want to focus on backend development, improving my knowledge of Linux, C++,
            and computer architecture.
            <br /><br /> In my free time, I enjoy Mounting Biking, Climbing, Guitar, Cooking, and building things.

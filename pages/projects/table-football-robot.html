    <p>At the Nottingham 24 hour Hackathon - HackNotts84, I led a team to win Intel's 1st place prize, building a table
        football robot and competing against over 40 teams from 25 universities across the UK.</p>

    <p>This was achieved using computer vision and parts of a 3D printer.</p>

    <p>We were able to track the location of the ball in real time using a webcam and OpenCV and send Gcode commands to
        the robot control board in order to intercept and kick the ball towards the goal.</p>

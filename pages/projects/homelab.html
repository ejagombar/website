    <p>The initial goal of this project was to self host a HA Kubernetes cluster to learn more about it. I designed and
        built a compact rack based off some Lenovo Mini PCs. After setting up K3S, I decided that Kubernetes was more
        effort than it was worth for a homelab environment and instead opted to set up a Proxmox server, where I hosted
        a number of services such as a VPN, Home Assistant, and my Spanner project. Now I am working on building a new
        and improved version of the server.</p>

    <p>Above is a picture of the finished server. The case was designed in Fusion360, and the rack contains an
        integrated switch and the power supplies, so it can all be powered via a single cable.</p>

    <p>For my master's project, I developed a gesture-controlled robotic hand. I designed and 3D printed a hand with 6
        degrees of motion. A microcontroller embedded in the hand is sent data from a Raspberry Pi, which receives
        finger position data via a UDP server from a desktop application. The desktop application utilizes computer
        vision to track the user's hand.</p>

    </div>

    <p>The desktop application was developed in Qt and implemented Google's machine learning MediaPipe library for the
        hand tracking. This data was translated into servo positions and sent over the internet via my server to the
        robotic hand. I was able to reduce the total system (including the hand tracking) latency to 320ms.</p>

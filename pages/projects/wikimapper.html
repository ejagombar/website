    <p>WikiMapper is a 3D graph visualisation tool, used to explore the links between Wikipedia Pages. This has been
        written from scratch in C++, using OpenGL for the graphics.</p>

    <p> A major emphasis of this project is performance. I have spent a considerable amount of time developing realistic
        imposter shaders for Spheres and Cylinders, helping to massively reduce the number of vertices required when
        rendering each frame. </p>

    <p>WikiLoader, a C++ Wikipedia XML file parser project was developed to extract the data from Wikipedia. The tool
        exports the pages (graph nodes) and their associated links (graph edges) into a Neo4j database using the
        Neo4j-admin tool. This program was parallelised, dropping the execution time to process the 100GB XML dump file
        by 70%.</p>

    <p>The above image is a picture of the software. This project is still a work in progress, and while I am able to
        load up pages and simulate their positions as a force-directed graph, there are many more features to be added.

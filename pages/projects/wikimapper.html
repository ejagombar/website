    <p>The WikiMapper project was inspired by the Wikipedia game where you have to traverse from one page of the site to
        another in as few jumps as possible using the links on the page.</p>

    <p>A simple C++ Wikipedia XML file parser was written to extract the pages (graph nodes) and their associated links
        (graph edges) into a Neo4j database using the Neo4j-admin tool. This program was parallelised, dropping the
        execution time to process the 100GB XML file by 70%.</p>

    <p>The built-in Neo4j tool allows for some basic visualisation, however due to the sheer size of the database (over
        300 million links) it was only able to represent a very small subsection of the graph.</p>

    <p>For this reason I am developing a 3D visualiser in OpenGL, using imposter Cylinders and imposter Spheres to
        reduce the number of vertices being rendered. Compute shaders have also been implemented to reduce the amount of
        data being sent to the GPU.</p>

    <p>Above is an image of the visualiser that is (hopefully) somewhat recent. The Cylinders and Sphere imposters took
        a long time to get working properly, but it means that each sphere and cylinder only consits of 4 vertices which
        is very important when there hundreds of thousands of them.</p>

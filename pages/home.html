        Hi, I am an Electronic and Computer Engineer, looking for a job in software engineering. I recently achieved a
        First class degree in my Master's at the University of Nottingham. <br /><br />

        In my free time, I enjoy working on software projects and building stuff. Some recent examples can be found
        under the portfolio page. I like to try new things and explore new areas, such as my current project,
        WikiMapper, where I am processing Wikipedia XML dumps with C++ to create a visual graph database. <br /><br />

        Now that I have graduated, I want to focus on backend development, improving my knowledge of Linux, C++, and
        computer architecture. <br /><br />

        In my free time, I enjoy Mounting Biking, Climbing, Guitar, Cooking, and building things.

        A Software Engineer at ThreatSpike, and a recent graduate from the University of Nottingham in
        Electronic and Computer Engineering (MEng). <br /><br />

        Outside of work, I enjoy working on low level software projects. Some recent examples can be found
        under the Projects page. In my current project, WikiMapper, I am processing Wikipedia XML dumps with C++ and
        using OpenGL to create a visualisation of the graph database. <br /><br />

        In my free time, I enjoy Mounting Biking, Climbing, Guitar, Cooking, and building things.

        Hi, I am a Software Engineer at ThreatSpike Labs. I recently graduated with a degree in
        Electronic and Computer Engineering (MEng) at the University of Nottingham. <br /><br />

        Outside of work, I enjoy working on low level software projects. Some recent examples can be found
        under the Projects page. In my current project, WikiMapper, I am processing Wikipedia XML dumps with C++ and
        using OpenGL to create a visualisation of the graph database. <br /><br />

        In my free time, I enjoy Mounting Biking, Climbing, Guitar, Cooking, and building things.
